# AI for Good - Google Ad Grants Compliant Campaign

## Campaign Overview

This folder contains the Google AdWords campaign materials for Humanitarians AI's "AI for Good" program. The campaign aims to promote our nonprofit research and software development initiatives that leverage artificial intelligence to address global challenges through cutting-edge research and innovative software solutions. All campaign activities strictly adhere to Google Ad Grants policies and exclusively promote mission-based activities with no commercial or unrelated services.

## Campaign Rationale

The "AI for Good" campaign targets individuals and organizations interested in the ethical application of AI for positive social impact. As AI technologies become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern about their potential risks and benefits. This campaign positions Humanitarians AI as a trusted leader in developing AI solutions that prioritize transparency, fairness, and accountability.

### Why This Campaign Matters

1. **Rising Public Interest**: There is increasing public interest in how AI can be used responsibly to address social challenges rather than exacerbate existing problems.

2. **Competitive Differentiation**: Many organizations claim to develop "AI for good," but few have our dual focus on both rigorous research and practical software implementation.

3. **Partnership Development**: This campaign helps identify potential research partners, software collaborators, and funding sources who share our commitment to ethical AI development.

4. **Educational Mission**: By raising awareness about responsible AI practices, we fulfill our educational mission even for those who don't directly engage with our programs.

5. **Talent Recruitment**: The campaign serves as a pipeline for identifying candidates for our Fellows Program who are passionate about ethical AI applications.
