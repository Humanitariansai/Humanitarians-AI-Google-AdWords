# Botspeak - Google Ad Grants Compliant Campaign

## Campaign Overview

This folder contains the Google AdWords campaign materials for Humanitarians AI's "Botspeak" program. The campaign aims to promote our comprehensive AI fluency framework that empowers individuals and organizations to effectively communicate with and utilize AI systems through YouTube videos, workshops, and educational resources. All campaign activities strictly adhere to Google Ad Grants policies and exclusively promote mission-based educational activities with no commercial or unrelated services.

## Campaign Rationale

The "Botspeak" campaign targets professionals, students, and organizations seeking to develop the skills necessary for effective human-AI collaboration. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into workplaces and daily life, the ability to interact effectively with these systems represents a new form of literacy. This campaign positions Humanitarians AI as a leader in developing AI fluency through our nine-pillar framework.

### Why This Campaign Matters

1. **Emerging Skill Gap**: There is a growing divide between those who can effectively utilize AI systems and those who cannot, creating both economic and educational disparities.

2. **Rapidly Evolving Technology**: As AI systems like large language models become more sophisticated, the need for structured approaches to human-AI interaction grows more urgent.

3. **Professional Development Need**: Professionals across industries are seeking ways to upskill in AI fluency to remain competitive in their fields.

4. **Educational Foundation**: By promoting structured approaches to AI interaction, we provide lasting cognitive tools rather than temporary techniques that quickly become outdated.

5. **Supporting Ethical AI Use**: Effective AI communication skills enable users to recognize limitations, identify biases, and use these tools more responsibly.
