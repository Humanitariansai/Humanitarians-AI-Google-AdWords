## Campaign Overview

This folder contains the Google AdWords campaign materials for Humanitarians AI's "Botspeak" program. The campaign aims to promote our comprehensive AI fluency framework that empowers individuals and organizations to effectively communicate with and utilize AI systems through educational resources. All campaign activities strictly adhere to Google Ad Grants policies and exclusively promote mission-based educational activities.

## Campaign Rationale

The "Botspeak" campaign targets professionals, students, and organizations seeking to develop the skills necessary for effective human-AI collaboration.
