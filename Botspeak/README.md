# Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a Google Ad Grants Campaign for Botspeak

Let me walk you through the detailed steps for setting up your Botspeak Google Ad Grants campaign, ensuring full compliance with all the requirements mentioned in your documents.

## Step 3: Create Your Campaign
1. Log into your Google Ads account
2. Click the "Campaigns" tab in the left navigation
3. Click the "+" button and select "New campaign"
4. Select "Search" as your campaign type
5. When prompted for a goal, select "Leads" (since your document mentions conversion tracking for program inquiries)
6. Name your campaign "Botspeak - AI Fluency Framework" 
7. Click "Continue"

## Step 4: Configure Campaign Settings
1. Set your daily budget to $329 (the maximum $10,000/month allocation)
2. For locations, set up specific geotargeting rather than broad targeting (as mentioned in your compliance document)
   - Select areas where your programs are most active
   - Avoid setting it to "United States" only, as specific geotargeting is required
3. Select English as your language
4. Under bidding section, select "Maximize conversions" bidding strategy
   - This is explicitly required for Ad Grants compliance per your document
5. In the networks section:
   - Enable "Google Search Network"
   - Disable "Search partners" 
6. Set campaign start date to today with no end date
7. Under "Show more settings":
   - Ensure "Ad rotation" is set to "Optimize: Prefer best performing ads"
   - Set up ad scheduling if you want to show ads only during certain times

## Step 5: Create Ad Groups
1. Create your first ad group named "Graduate AI Fluency" 
2. Create your second ad group named "Professional AI Fluency"
   - Having at least two ad groups is required per your compliance document

## Step 6: Select Keywords
For "Graduate AI Fluency" ad group:

1. Add the high-intent keywords from your document:
   - "AI skills for recent graduates"
   - "entry-level AI communication training"
   - "prompt engineering for new professionals"
   - "AI literacy for job seekers"
   - "career-focused AI fluency"

2. Add the awareness keywords:
   - "AI skills for job interviews"
   - "prompt engineering for resumes"
   - "graduate-level AI training"
   - "AI literacy for early career"
   - "AI communication for portfolios"

3. Add the long-tail keywords:
   - "developing AI communication skills for entry-level positions"
   - "prompt engineering techniques for new graduate portfolios"
   - "AI literacy frameworks for transitioning from education to workforce"
   - "building AI skills during post-graduation job search"
   - "essential AI fluency competencies for recent graduates"

4. Repeat the same process for "Professional AI Fluency" ad group using the corresponding keywords from your document

5. For all keywords:
   - Use phrase match (add quotation marks around keywords)
   - Ensure no single-word keywords (required by Google Ad Grants)
   - Set up automated rules to pause keywords with quality scores below 3

## Step 7: Create Ad Copy
For each ad group, create at least 3 responsive search ads:

1. "Graduate AI Fluency" Ad Example:
   - Headlines (create at least 8-10):
     * "AI Skills for Recent Graduates"
     * "Learn Effective AI Communication"
     * "Nonprofit AI Education Program"
     * "Master the Nine Pillars of Botspeak"
     * "Strategic AI Delegation for Graduates"
     * "AI Literacy for Early Career Success"
     * "Free AI Fluency Resources"
     * "Prompt Engineering for New Professionals"
   
   - Descriptions (create at least 4):
     * "Develop essential AI communication skills for your career. Our nonprofit Botspeak framework teaches effective human-AI collaboration."
     * "Master all nine pillars of AI fluency: Strategic Delegation, Effective Communication, Critical Evaluation, and more. Free educational resources."
     * "Botspeak is the new literacy for the age of AI. Our 501(c)(3) nonprofit provides educational resources for recent graduates."
     * "Learn to communicate effectively with AI systems. Enhance your resume with critical AI skills employers seek."

2. Repeat the same process for "Professional AI Fluency" ad group with appropriate headlines and descriptions focused on mid-career professionals

3. For all ads:
   - Include your keywords in headlines and descriptions
   - Emphasize educational mission only
   - Focus on the nine pillars mentioned in your document
   - Ensure all headlines and descriptions are unique
   - Use strong calls-to-action

## Step 8: Set Up Ad Extensions
Create and add these extensions to both ad groups:

   - Click the "+" button to create a new conversion action
   - Select "Website" as the conversion source
   - Enter the conversion details (name, value, count)
   - Set up the tracking tag (either install it yourself or use Google Tag Manager)
   - Install the tag on the relevant "thank you" or confirmation pages

4. Verify that conversion tracking is working properly:
   - Test each conversion action yourself
   - Check the "Conversions" column in your Google Ads reports

## Step 10: Compliance Monitoring
Set up weekly checks to monitor:

1. Click-through rate (CTR):
   - Must remain above 5% account-wide
   - Create an automated rule to notify you if it drops below 5.5%

2. Keyword quality:
   - Set up automated rules to pause keywords with quality scores below 3
   - Review quality scores weekly and optimize low-performing keywords

3. Campaign structure:
   - Ensure you maintain at least 2 ad groups with closely related keywords
   - Maintain at least 2 active sitelink extensions

4. Geotargeting:
   - Verify that specific geotargeting is maintained (not broad targeting)

5. Compliance rules:

   - Address any warnings immediately

## Step 11: Launch and Optimize
