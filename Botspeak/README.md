# Botspeak - Google AdWords Campaign

## Campaign Overview

This folder contains the Google AdWords campaign materials for Humanitarians AI's "Botspeak" program. The campaign aims to promote our comprehensive AI fluency framework that empowers individuals and organizations to effectively communicate with and utilize AI systems through YouTube videos, workshops, and educational resources.

## Campaign Rationale

The "Botspeak" campaign targets professionals, students, and organizations seeking to develop the skills necessary for effective human-AI collaboration. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into workplaces and daily life, the ability to interact effectively with these systems represents a new form of literacy. This campaign positions Humanitarians AI as a leader in developing AI fluency through our nine-pillar framework.
