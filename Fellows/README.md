# Fellows Program - Google Ad Grants Compliant Campaign

## Campaign Overview

This folder contains the Google AdWords campaign materials for Humanitarians AI's "Fellows Program." The campaign aims to promote our bridge program that supports emerging AI researchers, practitioners, and community leaders in developing responsible AI solutions while connecting them with experienced mentors. All campaign activities strictly adhere to Google Ad Grants policies and exclusively promote mission-based educational activities.

## Campaign Rationale

Our Fellows Program targets recent graduates seeking to build their portfolios and gain experience, with a **primary focus on recruiting mentors** to address our critical shortage. We have an abundance of qualified fellows applying to the program, but we face a significant challenge in finding enough experienced professionals willing to mentor them. This campaign positions mentorship as a meaningful way for AI professionals to give back to the community while developing their own leadership skills.

### Why This Campaign Matters

1. **Critical Mentor Shortage**: We have significantly more qualified fellows than available mentors, creating a bottleneck in our ability to serve recent graduates.

2. **OPT Eligible Program**: Our volunteer program allows recent graduates to learn by doing AI after graduation, but requires proper mentorship to be effective.

3. **Industry Connection**: Mentors provide the vital bridge between academic knowledge and industry application, helping fellows develop career-ready skills.

4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Experienced professionals have valuable insights about responsible AI development that can only be effectively transmitted through mentorship relationships.

5. **Community Building**: Mentors become part of a growing network of ethical AI practitioners committed to ensuring AI benefits everyone.
