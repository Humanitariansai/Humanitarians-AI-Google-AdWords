# Fellows - Google AdWords Campaign

## Campaign Overview

This folder contains the Google AdWords campaign materials for Humanitarians AI's "Fellows Program." The campaign aims to promote our bridge program that supports emerging AI researchers, practitioners, and community leaders in developing responsible AI solutions while connecting them with experienced mentors.

## Campaign Rationale

While the Fellows Program targets recent graduates seeking to build their portfolios and gain experience, this campaign has a **primary focus on recruiting mentors** to address our critical shortage. We have an abundance of qualified fellows applying to the program, but we face a significant challenge in finding enough experienced professionals willing to mentor them. This campaign positions mentorship as a meaningful way for AI professionals to give back to the community while developing their own leadership skills.

### Why This Campaign Matters

1. **Critical Mentor Shortage**: We have significantly more qualified fellows than available mentors, creating a bottleneck in our ability to serve recent graduates.

2. **OPT Eligible Program**: Our volunteer program allows recent graduates to learn by doing AI after graduation, but requires proper mentorship to be effective.

3. **Industry Connection**: Mentors provide the vital bridge between academic knowledge and industry application, helping fellows develop career-ready skills.

4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Experienced professionals have valuable insights about responsible AI development that can only be effectively transmitted through mentorship relationships.

5. **Community Building**: Mentors become part of a growing network of ethical AI practitioners committed to ensuring AI benefits everyone.

## Target Audiences

### Primary Audience (Mentors):
1. **Mid to Senior AI Professionals**: Industry practitioners with 5+ years of experience
2. **AI Research Scientists**: Individuals with advanced degrees working in research institutions
3. **AI Ethics Specialists**: Professionals focused on responsible AI development
4. **Technical Leaders**: Engineering managers and team leads with mentoring experience
5. **Former Fellows**: Previous program participants who have established themselves in the industry
6. **Academic AI Researchers**: Professors and researchers in AI-related fields

### Secondary Audience (Fellows):
1. **Recent Graduates**: Individuals with degrees in AI, computer science, data science, or related fields
